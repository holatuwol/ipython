===============================

We are currently marketing DXP as a digital transformation platform that enables omni-channel experiences and enriches customer relationship insight.

- `Digital Experience Platform <https://www.liferay.com/digital-experience-platform>`__

More explicitly, the following is how we elaborate each of those three attributes.

	Digital Transformation **Platform**

	* **Easy Integration**: Give customers secure access to information and apps hidden deep in your systems.
	* **Modular Services**: Quickly implement and evolve digital strategy with reusable and resilient services.
	* **Runtime Platform**: Support any digital business model with our resilient support for cloud and on-premise infrastructures.

	Omni Channel **Experiences**

	* **Modern Web**: Build web experiences with fast, usable interfaces customers will love.
	* **Mobile**: Create native apps and mobile sites with push notifications and camera and GPS.
	* **Digital Hybrid**: Enhance in-store experiences with digital context and services.

	Customer Relationship **Insight**

	* **Personalization and Segments**: Refine your understanding of your audience's needs and interests with targeted information and segment identification.
	* **Analytics and Metrics**: Help users get what they need. Use data to evolve touch points and increase click-through and conversion.
	* **Single View of the Customer**: Get a full understanding of what customers are doing across all touch points.

Neither of the first two deviate substantially from where Liferay lived in the portal space. We often look at both digital transformation and omni channel as a natural progression of portal, and we emphasize the natural-ness of that progression in our marketing and sales comparisons of portal heritage DXPs to other DXP variants. Our features list also emphasizes these capabilities.

However, the last attribute is very different from where Liferay lived in the portal space, because insight isn't an organic extension of a portal at all. To uncover insight, DXP must show you where to look for insightful questions, and DXP must guide you on your search for your insightful answers. In other words, you need to understand what an insightful question might be and how to frame the answers in a way that they generate insight.

However, of these three attributes, insight is our marketing messaging push. So when building a DXP, its developers and maintainers and essentially everyone who engages our user base should be able to answer the following three questions:

1. What types of questions will our users try to ask with a DXP?
2. How will users attempt to use DXP and its data to answer those questions?
3. How will each of these different answers translate to insight?
